# using TextField Widget for the user to input some text data to the form

# for calculating EMI
# eg : amount -> 1000
# tenure -> 12 month
# so amount/tenure = principle amount = per month cost
# also ROI for the amount say 10% -> ROI = ( amount*10% ) / tenure (per month cost) = ROI
# now principle amount + ROI = EMI
# for EMi pie chart use pie from pub.dev; https://pub.dev/packages/pie_chart/versions/5.2.0/install
